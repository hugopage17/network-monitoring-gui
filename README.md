# network-monitoring-gui
This app is still in development stage however it is a Windows desktop app that can monitor IP based networks and devices.
The developer stack involves React and Redux in the front end with react charts and google maps and uses web sockets to talk
to the backend which runs off NodeJS and executes all the network diagnostic functions such as latency testing, tracerouting 
and ssh. The app is then packaged into the ElectronJS framework so that it can be render as a desktop app.
